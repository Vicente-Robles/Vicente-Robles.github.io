This study explores the impact of gas-entrapping microstructures made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on cavitation bubble dynamics. The microstructures are created through a scalable laser ablation technique and demonstrated the ability to repel cavitation bubbles by causing entrapped air pockets to expand and oscillate. This research suggests the potential for directing cavitation bubble collapse away from surfaces to reduce erosion or improve microfluidic mixing in low Reynolds number flows.

Several experiments were conducted over three stand-off distances to quantify the degree of repulsion and stability of the surfaces. In all cases near the untreated surface, the bubble collapses towards the boundary, producing a radially expanding toroidal impact on the surface. In contrast, the microstructured surfaces tend to repel the cavitation bubble while there are sufficient in-tact entrapped air pockets.
