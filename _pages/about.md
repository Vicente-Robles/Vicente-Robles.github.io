I am a skilled engineer specializing in optical systems. I execute design, data analysis, modeling and laboratory techniques to transform concepts into functional prototypes. In my recent roles, I have worked on projects focused on non-intrusive measurements, evaluating performance and safety of optical systems, and preparing and presenting technical reports to clients. 

I offer a well-rounded skill set with experience in CAD, high-speed imaging, prototyping, opto-mechanics, and a background in mechanical engineering, heat transfer, and fluids. 

I am currently exploring new opportunities. Feel free to [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roblesvicente/) to initiate discussions about potential collaborations.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
