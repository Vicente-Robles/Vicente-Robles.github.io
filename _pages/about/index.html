I execute design, data analysis, modeling and laboratory techniques to transform concepts into functional prototypes. In my recent roles, I have worked on projects focused on non-intrusive measurements, evaluating performance and safety of optical systems, and preparing and presenting technical reports to clients.</p> <p>I offer a well-rounded skill set with experience in CAD, high-speed imaging, prototyping, opto-mechanics, and a background in mechanical engineering, heat transfer, and fluids.</p> <p>I am currently exploring new opportunities.
